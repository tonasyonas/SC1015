
GitHub Repo

This codebase should contain your codes/notebooks and data files, as required, for the complete project.
The repo may tentatively follow the structure and flow of examples under "Video Presentation Guidelines".
The repo must include a decently composed README file for your TA to read and understand the project.
It is unlikely that your TA will execute your codes for every single project, but they will read the README.
You may include a copy of your slides that you used in the video presentation (not mandatory) in the repo.

About:
Contained within are the source codes for our SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) Mini-Project. Our mini-project utilizes the Fake News dataset based on FakeNewsNet by Aleksei Golovin in order to develop machine learning algorithms that can accurately discern fake news from real news and analyze the factors that differentiate them.

Models Used: Naive-Bayes Model and Random Forest Classifier

Conclusion: From the table, the random forest classifier is better than the naive-bayes model in terms of K-fold accuracy and accuracy. Hence, it is a better model compared to naive-bayes. However, the accuracy is not 1 so we can explore different models to achieve even more accurate results.

What did we learn from this project?
In conclusion, we found out that it is possible to predict and discern fake news from real news using ML models. Furthermore, we can do to a large extent as seen from the high accuracy and F1 score for both models. While the number may not be perfectly 1, they are still very acceptable and accurate. 

However, there are some possible improvements. The dataset has limited factors. It would be better if we have a more comprehensive and detailed dataset with more factors such as not limited to just words in the title and number of upvotes. For example, the number of comments, the number of reshares and demographic statistics. More factors can lead to an accurate dataset and reduce biases due to certain factors having more correlation with the fake and real news. 

We can also explore different models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural networks, known for their powerful ability to draw out relationships and predict to a larger extent as they work well on non-linear relationships between predictors and responses. 

Additionally, we can also implement a feedback system to improve the model’s learning. For example, people can rate ChatGPT answers to give their satisfaction based on the answers given. Users can provide feedback on the responses generated by the model. When a user submits feedback, it is sent to a database where it is stored along with the corresponding response from the model. The feedback is then used to improve the model's performance. The data is analyzed to identify patterns and areas where the model may need to be improved. The feedback is then used to retrain the model, so it can generate better responses in the future. This helps the model to learn from its mistakes and become better at generating responses over time.
